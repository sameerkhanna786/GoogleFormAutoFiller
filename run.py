Simple script to add responses to a simple Google form that only takes one number.

Go to your form page, and click Responses > Get pre-filled URL. It'll ask you to do a sample fill-out of your form. Put in responses that easily let you see what question you're answering. Once you hit submit, it's going to give you a URL in the form of...
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/<form_id>/viewform?entry.XXXXXXX=____&entry.YYYYYY=____...
