# GoogleFormAutoFiller
Simple script that allows for repeated autofilling of a simple google form using CSRF principles.

## Setup
Make sure you have the python package psutil installed. It allows python to identify running processes, which allows for easy closing of browsers. All other packages used should be built-in; if not however, please install the packages you are missing.

Open the file and go the parameters section. Follow the comments and variable names and edit these to suit your purposes.

Once this is done, navigate to the directory in terminal and type in "python run.py"!
